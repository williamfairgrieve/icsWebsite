        <p>My interests and activities include learning about electronics 
            and designing circuits to do interesting tasks.  I am also 
            interested in making utility programs to automate things that
            become tedious to do manually.  I am also interested in 
            playing video games that I find interesting and fun to play.
        </p>
        <p>I have
            recently ordered components to detect gases in the air and a seven segment
            display, which I am exited to learn how to control.  I also purchased
            a 555 timer, which I am interested in using in a number of different
            scenarios.  I might buy a project enclosure and make a simple gas detector
            that will light up an LED and make a noise if the levels are over a
            certain limit.
