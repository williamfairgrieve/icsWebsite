            My main goals this year are to get straight Aâ€™s and to learn 
            as much as possible in all of my classes.  This year I am 
            especially interested in learning more about Chemistry, 
            as well as learning as much as I can about electronics.
            I will turn 16 in just under two months, and am exited to begin
            getting my driver's license.
